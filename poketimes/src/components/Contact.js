                <p>Why did you bring us here? Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! I don't want to be rescued.

Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Noooooo! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!

Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!</p>
